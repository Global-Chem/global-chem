# Code of Conduct

As I open up the repository for discussions, I need to ensure there is a proper code of conduct being enforced. I, Sulstice, am the maintainer of the repository and
have my own team that I will ask for social decisions in regards to different posts. I want science to be a safe place for us to converse. It is not easy and I have struggled
for a long time to learn. 

I only want to learn more and anything that prevents that or doesn't help. Learning is done through love and friendship and this project serves just that purpose
as we try to find the thin layer of data that connects us all. 

Be safe, code, discuss post accordingly. Please send me an e-mail if something happens and I will take action.
